## Description:

Watch Functionality Video:

The README.md file is essential for deployed GitHub web applications because it serves as the first point of contact for anyone who visits your repository. It provides a brief overview of what your application does, how to use it, and any additional information that may be helpful to users or other developers.

A well-crafted README.md file can help to establish credibility and professionalism, as it demonstrates your attention to detail and your willingness to provide clear and concise documentation. This can be particularly important for potential employers or collaborators who may be interested in your work.

### Installation:

To install this project, a knowledge of JavaScript, Node.js, and NPM Packages were required. I had to first install Node.js to my computer and then install the NPM and Inquirer packages. The Inquirer package provides a set of tools for building command-line interfaces (CLIs). It allowed me to create interactive prompts for users, enabling them to input information and providing responses accordingly to create their README.md file through the command line. Methods used ranged from, Template Literals, Arrow Functions, Inquirer, Objects, and Functions, Variables, If/Else Statements, and the node package.json. The web application is intended for the user to be able to open their integrated terminal, input “node index.js” into the command line, and immediately, through the terminal, be prompted with a list of questions. These questions, when answered, will allow the user to have their README.md file auto generated with the inputs they give in the terminal. The code below makes this happen.
