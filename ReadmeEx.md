## Description:
Your GitHub profile is an extremely important aspect of your public identity as a developer. A well-crafted one allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers. An important component of your GitHub profile—and one that many new developers often overlook—is the README.md file.The quality of a README often differentiates a good project from a bad project. 

## Installation: 
What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running. A good installation section one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase what certain aspects of your code do and how they function to make your web application work. 



## Usage:
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

## Credits:
List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section. If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License:

## Contributions:
If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. I walked down the street and saw someone walking down the way towards me and I said hello. I want an industry standard, but you can always write your own.
